Please help me analyze the following argument using the method of *standardizing*. This method involves five key steps:

1. **Identify and clarify the argument’s structure**:  
   Carefully read the passage. Determine the main conclusion (which may be implicit), along with any major premises and subconclusions. Paraphrase any part of the argument as needed to enhance clarity—ensuring your paraphrase is clear, concise, accurate, and charitable (i.e., represents the author’s intent fairly and in the strongest possible light).

2. **Remove irrelevant content**:  
   Omit any information that is redundant, rhetorical, or not logically relevant to the reasoning.

3. **Number and order the statements logically, then visualize the structure**:  
Assign a number to each premise, subconclusion, and main conclusion, listing them in a sequence that reflects their logical order—placing supporting statements *before* the conclusions they support.  

Then, create a simple **ASCII flowchart** beneath the numbered list to illustrate how the statements connect. Use arrows (`-->`) or branching structures to show which premises lead to which conclusions. For example:

```
1. All humans are mortal.  
2. Socrates is a human.  
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (from 1, 2)

Flowchart:
1 -->\
      +--> 3
2 -->/
```

The goal is to make the inferential pathways clear at a glance, especially in complex arguments with multiple subconclusions.


4. **Supply missing elements**:  
   Add any unstated but essential premises or conclusions that are necessary for the argument to hold together logically (often called “implicit assumptions”).

5. **Justify each inferential step**:  
   For every conclusion or subconclusion, include a brief note in parentheses indicating exactly which earlier statement(s) it is supposed to follow from (e.g., “from 2 and 4”).

Apply this standardizing process to the provided paragraph so the argument’s logical structure becomes explicit and easy to evaluate.
