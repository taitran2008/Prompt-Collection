Please help me analyze the following argument using the method of *standardizing*. This method involves five key steps:

1. **Identify and clarify the argument’s structure**:  
   Carefully read the passage. Determine the main conclusion (which may be implicit), along with any major premises and subconclusions. Paraphrase any part of the argument as needed to enhance clarity—ensuring your paraphrase is clear, concise, accurate, and charitable (i.e., represents the author’s intent fairly and in the strongest possible light).

2. **Remove irrelevant content**:  
   Omit any information that is redundant, rhetorical, or not logically relevant to the reasoning.

3. **Number and order the statements logically**:  
   Assign a number to each premise and conclusion, listing them in the order that reflects their logical dependency—placing supporting premises before the conclusions they are meant to support.

4. **Supply missing elements**:  
   Add any unstated but essential premises or conclusions that are necessary for the argument to hold together logically (often called “implicit assumptions”).

5. **Justify each inferential step**:  
   For every conclusion or subconclusion, include a brief note in parentheses indicating exactly which earlier statement(s) it is supposed to follow from (e.g., “from 2 and 4”).

Apply this standardizing process to the provided paragraph so the argument’s logical structure becomes explicit and easy to evaluate.
